I installed antlr4 and the python extensions

pacman -S antlr4 python-antlr4 as well.

For whatever reason, I don't get the antlr4 shell script tool to run and this tool is required to create the python (class) files from a g4 file.

So there are two options:

#1 We use the jar file provided by the package. Advantage is that versions between antlr4 and the python extensions match.

java -jar /usr/share/java/antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar -Dlanguage=Python3 -visitor ListInit.g4

#2 We download the antlr4 jar file from the natlr4 website & use this for generating the python (class) files.

java -jar antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar -Dlanguage=Python3 -visitor ListInit.g4
